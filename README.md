## Abstract
This project was an opportunity to practice writing HTML, CSS, and Javascript mostly from scratch, trying to match the provided comp and deliver requested functionality. It was a great chance to try integrating all three and making them mesh together. The result is a webpage that spits out affirmations or mantras, and allows the user to add new sayings to the array of randomly-selected offerings.

## Wins
- This was great practice in working with JavaScript event listeners and handlers, and it was fun playing around with CSS to see how flexible it is!

## Challenges + Improvements
- CSS is also very finicky! It's easy to get things working for one setup, only to have to reconfigure it when a new feature is introduced.
